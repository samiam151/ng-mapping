For example, breakfast options feature grass-fed meats and cage free eggs (e.g., whole grain pancakes, French toast, fresh seasonal fruits, whole grain hot cereals, breads, muffins and pastries). During lunch, the fare will include fresh soups, house-made burgers, signature sandwiches, smoothies, garden fresh seasonal salads with homemade and nutritious dressings, signature pies, cakes and cookies, and locally inspired beverages. Only three of the more than 30 farmers\u2019 markets in the District of Columbia are located east of the Anacostia River. NSL has entered into an agreement with DMPED to provide 10 hours of programming each month at Gateway DC and/or the R.I.S.E. Demonstration Center. The programs (nutrition counseling, basic food handling, cooking classes, and interactive food demonstrations) will be offered in a state-of-the-art teaching kitchen at low or no-cost to the public. To support this effort, NSL will utilize Ms. Bailey-Joyner\u2019s previous experience as well as a consultant with considerable expertise in developing successful community mapping and outreach programs focused on improving access to healthy food options. More than 6,000 employees at the St. Elizabeths campus will purchase fresh snacks and meals from MSC, the only full-service restaurant in the St. Elizabeths East Gateway Pavilion. This inviting and historic183-acre campus setting will also serve as a gathering place that provides information, free Wi-Fi services, offer guests a library with more than 1,000 books and during the evening hours cooking demonstrations to help individuals make incremental but critical changes to their diet and food choices. The opening of MSC on the St. Elizabeths campus also improves commercial vibrancy along one of the District\u2019s emerging corridors and in surrounding neighborhoods.",

Simultaneously, we work to improve their interpersonal, team, leadership, or overall organization performance by providing OD solutions such as teambuilding, leadership development, and/or training. We also create communications strategies connected to the changes that are occurring and recommend/work to implement innovative HR solutions. Specifically, we design improvements to HR performance management systems and design reorganizations.
